### 我是一名来自中国的理论经济学研究生，目标研究方向是行为与发展经济学，当前正就读于武汉大学经济与管理学院，行为经济学研究者致力于分析基于超越理性人假说的经济学理论，在多极化与差异化的世界格局之下，发展经济学研究者致力于消除贫困、关注经济公平、促进发展中国家现代化，因此行为与发展经济学的核心是研究经济发展的行为机制并以此来改善全人类的福利。中国是历经上下五千年而经久不衰的文明古国，开放包容是中华民族的传统美德，推动前沿经济科学研究的国际化交流与合作，是每一位中国本土经济学研究者的共同愿景！

I am a graduate student of theoretical economics from China, behavioral and development economics is my target research direction. Currently, I am studying at the School of Economics and Management of Wuhan University. Behavioral economics researchers are committed to analyzing economic theories based on the hypothesis of transcending rational man. Development economics researchers are committed to eliminating poverty, focusing on economic equity, and promoting modernization in developing countries. Therefore, the core of behavior and development economics is to study the behavior mechanism of economic development and improve the welfare of all mankind. China is an ancient civilization that has endured for more than five thousand years. Openness and inclusiveness are the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation. To promote international exchanges and cooperation in frontier economic science research is the common vision of every Chinese local economics researcher!
